|Error estimates of residual minimization using neural networks for linear PDEs | We propose an abstract framework for analyzing the convergence of least-squares methods based on residual minimization when feasible solutions are neural networks. With the norm relations and compactness arguments, we derive error estimates for both continuous and discrete formulations of residual minimization in strong and weak forms. The formulations cover recently developed physics-informed neural networks based on strong and variational formulations. | | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08019.pdf) |
|Estimation of 3D Velocity and Pressure Fields from Tomographic Background Oriented Schlieren Videos using a Physics-Informed Neural Network |PINNs seamlessly integrate the underlying physics of the observed fluid flow and the visualization data, hence enabling the inference of latent quantities using limited experimental data. In this hidden fluid mechanics paradigm, the neural network is trained by minimizing a loss function composed of a data mismatch term and a residual term associated with the coupled Navier-Stokes and temperature equations. The proposed method is first validated based on a 2D set of synthetic data for buoyancy-driven flow, and subsequently it is applied to the 3D Tomo-BOS data set. We demonstrate that by using PINNs, we are able to quantify accurately the instantaneous three-dimensional velocity and pressure of the flow over a coffee mug based on the temperature field provided by the tomographic Tomo-BOS imaging. | | [APS Physics](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD20/Session/R01.27) |
